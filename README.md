# Deflection-of-Beams
In this program we will determine the Modulus of Elasticity of Steel and Ensure that the clamping of a fixed beam works.  To determine Young's Modulus(E1):
    1. Input the beam's cross-section and length.  
    2. Determine its Second Moment of Area.
    3. Plot a graph of loading(w grams) Vs. Deflection (d, millimetres)
    4. Determine the slope of the graph.
    5. Use the derived deflectioin equaton to determine the modulus of Elasticity.
To ensure integrity of clamping of the fixed beam:
    1. Input the data
    2. Plot a graph of loading vs deflection
    3. Determine the slope of the graph
    4. Use the derived equation of delection of fixed beam with central point loading to determine the Young's Modulus.
    5. If the Young's Modulus obtained is equal to the initial one; then the clamping is effective.
